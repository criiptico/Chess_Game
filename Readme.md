# Chess Game through Command Prompt
    Just as the title says. This will be the development of a chess game through the command prompt.
    I have other ideas for projects I could do, but I think this is a good starter.
    
# Organizing areas of interest
    There are three different areas to the game: chess board, chess piece, and chess piece logic. They're all equally as important, but
    the main concerns for each of them are containers, addresses, and logic, respectively.
