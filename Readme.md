# Chess Game through Command Prompt
    Just as the title says. This will be the development of a chess game through the command prompt.
    I have other ideas for projects I could do, but I think this is a good starter.
    
# Organizing areas of interest
    There are three different areas to the game: chess board, chess piece, and chess piece logic. They're all equally as important, but
    the main concerns for each of them are containers, addresses, and logic, respectively.
    
# Terminal UI
    Once I finish all of the loginc code and such that I need to actually run the program, 
    I want to input this UI library I found as I was casually browsing Github. 
    You can find this in the following link:
    https://github.com/ArthurSonzogni/FTXUI . 
    It's a library that makes the terminal a bit more UI friendly-eske. The functionality I want to implement is the toggle feature.
    I'm not sure how to make it so that it differentiates and- actually make it known which piece is which, but for now I want to
    continue with doing it the hard and difficult way of actually hard coding the different spaces and such so I can learn that part.
    (I also want to put in that library though, so I need to look that up- well, read through this stackoverflow page I found 
    regarding how to use non-standard libraries in C++:

 # Chess AI
    This is something I wish I could implement myself but I'm not completely sure how to do it, so I'll provide a link to someone who
    already made one- and make sure to look here Chess-AI/src/mcts_network/
